	This plugin allows you to add achievements and rankings to your CE App. It's modeled along the lines of StackOverflow or other similar sites, where users gain points for doing certain things (achievements), and those points accumulate to help them gain new and better rankings.
</p>	
	
<p>
	This plugin is ready for i18n (currently locale file exists only for English), and makes it easy to increase engagement in your community by awarding points and rankings to actions you wish to encourage. For example, you could give users points for posting comments, inviting friends, or completing their profile information.

<p>Requires CommunityEngine version 1.0.4 or greater</p>
