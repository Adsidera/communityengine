	This plugin helps you make money from your CE-based community site by allowing you to charge members for premium content or features. It's currently in use on <a href="http://tennismetro.com/upgrade_account" title="Find local tennis courts & players - TennisMetro">TennisMetro.com</a> and <a href="http://curbly.com/subscriptions" title="Showing subscriptions &raquo; Curbly | DIY Design Community">Curbly.com</a>.</p>

<p>
	Recurring subscriptions and payment processing are handled through Amazon Payments (by default), so you don't have to worry about dealing directly with credit cards.
</p>

<p>
	Flexible implementation is ready for i18n (currently locale file exists only for English), and makes it simple to wall off any section of your community to non-premium members. For example, you could make blogging, private messaging, or certain types of blog or forum content available only to premium members.
</p>

<p>Requires CommunityEngine version 1.2.0 or greater</p>
